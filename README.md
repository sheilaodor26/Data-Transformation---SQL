# Data-Transformation---SQL
Using the video game sales in 2016 database, a report to show average global sales and sorting into columns using SQL. I examined the database columns to understand their relevance in this case.

# Was the average of global sales higher before or after 2010?
To compare average global sales before and after 2010, I used a "CASE"statement to label each record as 'pre-2010' or 'post-2010' grouped as year_category. Then I determined the average global sales for each period by ordering the average sales column in descending order.
